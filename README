mp: A Music Player
==================

This is a simple command line music player. It will play individual music files 
(flac, mp3, and ogg), directories that contain music files, and m3u play lists.

Tested with Python version 2.7 under Fedora Linux. You will need install the 
python gstreamer module with:
    yum install gstreamer-python
You also need to install the necessary gstreamer plugins, which are in the RPM 
Fusion non-free repository. Once you install the rpm-fusion free and non-free 
repository, install the plugins with
    yum install gstreamer-plugins-good gstreamer-plugins-ugly

To get the source code:
> git clone git@github.com:KenKundert/mp.git

Once cloned, you can get the latest updates using:
> git pull

To install into ~/local (modify the script to change the install directory):
> ./install

Be sure to add ~/local/lib/python to your PYTHONPATH.

To read the MP manual:
> man mp

To run MP:
> mp music-files
