mp: A Music Player
==================

This is a simple command line music player. It will play individual music files 
(flac, mp3, and ogg), directories that contain music files, and m3u play lists.

Tested with Python version 2.7 under Fedora Linux. You will need install the 
python docutils and the gstreamer module and plugins with:
    yum install python-docutils gstreamer-python gstreamer-plugins-good
If you want mp3 support, you also need to install the 'ugly' plugins from the 
RPM Fusion non-free repository.
    yum install gstreamer-plugins-ugly
If you do not want mp3 support, edit config.py and remove 'mp3' from 
mediaFileExtensions.

To get the source code:
$ git clone git@github.com:KenKundert/mp.git

Once cloned, you can get the latest updates using:
$ git pull

To install into ~/local (modify the script to change the install directory):
$ ./install

Be sure to add ~/local/lib/python to your PYTHONPATH.

To read the MP manual:
$ man mp

To run MP:
$ mp music-files
